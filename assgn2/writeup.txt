1. Brandon Tharp, Zubin Hathiram, CS4318

2. We plan to meet as time allows, but we are going to a point to meet at least every other day as the due date drawers nearer.

3. We plan to implement the parser following the rules of LR(1) grammer along with the use of semantics to develop the tree and symbol table.
   The Symbol Table will be implemented using a Hash Table to store and retrieve ids.
   An AST will be used to structure the parser's tree as well.

    Furthermore, all parties contributed equally for this assignment.
